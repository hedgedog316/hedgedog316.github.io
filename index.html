		<h4>They are alot of work so you have to be resonsible, caring, and pateient.
		I have a hedgehog and I love it.They love toliet paper rools but they get their head stuck in it.One of the down sides is how bad their health can get. Than can get really sick and die, go blind, and so much more.If you get them from a proper breader and keep them clean and clean their things you can keep them from getting sick.Just be care with the cage and wheel you get they will try to climb the cage and if the wheel has holes in it their feet will get stuck and they can break their legs.You will not regret it; they are so entertaining.Hedgehogs.... get one. Enjoy this game on scratch.</h4>
